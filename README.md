# Audio Amplifier Using NPN Transistors

## 📜 Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the amplification of a weak audio signal using **two-stage NPN transistor amplifiers**. The amplified signal is strong enough to drive a small speaker, making it audible and practical for real-world audio enhancement.


## 📝 Project Description:
- **Input:** Weak audio signal from a headphone jack.
- **Amplification Stages:**
    - Stage 1: Initial amplification using NPN transistor.
    - Stage 2: Further amplification using a second NPN transistor.
- **Coupling Capacitor:** Blocks DC components and passes only the AC audio signal.
- **Output:** Loud audio signal on a connected speaker.

### Key Concepts:
- Transistor Biasing
- AC/DC Signal Separation
- Capacitor Coupling
- Voltage Amplification
